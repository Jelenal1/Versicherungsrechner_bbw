This React project is a damage and insurance amount calculator that allows users to log in via Firebase and, when logged in, saves the calculated values to a Firestore database.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to simplify the calculation of damage and insurance amounts. It can also provide an overview of one's household.

### Planning During the Project
